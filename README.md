# Demo Next.js React 18 Server Component Streaming

Live demo: https://nextjs-react-18-server-component-streaming.vercel.app.

In this demo, you will see 3 components that will be displayed in async manner.

With NextJS 13.4 and React 18, as much as possible, we should push any blocking call to the components that actually needs the data.

If possible, the frame / root of the page should be rendered with no blocking dependency call.
